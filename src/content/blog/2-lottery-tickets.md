I caught up with Quang at a coffee shop this morning

It's fun because I haven't seen him for over five years

I bought five lottery tickets

Today is the last day of the Year of the Dragon

Later this evening, I cleaned the house

After work, I took Chien to Aunt Thuy's house

But no one was home

Back home, I checked the lottery results

I won 200k dong on two tickets

Tonight, I played cards with Lom and Gon

I also won 25k dong
