Today is the last day of 2024

Let's take a quick recap of this year

Well, this year, I have some personal goals, and have completed 2 of them.

I haven't taken the IELTS exam or published my book yet

I had a memorable trip to Da Nang with Grandma in the middle of the year

I then got a new job

This is my best decision of this year because my previous company conducted layoffs today
