Today is the last day of 2025

This year was hard for me

I lost my job in June and worked for Mom delivering noodles

This was the most difficult time in 2025, but it also gave me new opportunities

I went to Sai Gon, then My Tho with Aunt Em's family in July

I also saw with Uncle Tan, Aunt Em's ex-husband, again after many years

I also went to Cambodia, which was the scariest thing I have done this year, and then visited Aunt Lan, went to La Gi and finally Da Lat myself

In the end of October and the beginning of December, I experienced four extreme floodings

Dad got serious sick from walking in the cold water

My main goal of this year was to study for the IELTS test and studying abroad next year

However, the tution fees are too high

My transcript also includes credits from an organization that is not accreditted, so I could not apply

So I had to change my plan and signed up for a Bachelor's degree in business administration

I also learned to crochet, and made a scarf and a beanie

In November, I travelled to Da Nang with Gon for two days, and when coming home, I met Lom's boyfriend, Jadin

Ironically, I haven't completed any of my new year's resolutions
