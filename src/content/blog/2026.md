Happy New Year!

After a hard year of 2025, I want to keep this year's resolutions simple

My main goal is to learn something new

I am considering two options, studying a Bachelor's degree in business administration and a cooking class

I prefer the latter one because it is faster and I can make my own food

I also have some ideas that I want to do this year, and some of them are related to cooking
