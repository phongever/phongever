I picked up Ben after work this evening

At my home, I fed him a lot of bear-shaped cookies

Afterward, I took him and Chien for a walk to Aunt Thuy's house

When Ai Trinh's older daughter saw the dogs, she screamed and ran away

But her younger sister was sitting by the door and looking at me with a big smile
