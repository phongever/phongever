It was a busy day today

After breakfast, I soaked the teddy bear, helped Grandma locate a rat's corpse, fixed the leaky kitchen faucet, and cleaned the house

In the evening, I washed the bear, gave Chien a bath, and swept the yard

While I was taking rest, Aunt Thuy called to let me know that Ben was waiting for me to pick up him

I brought Chien over to her house and let them play together
