My family had a death anniversary party this afternoon

So I was off this evening

After the party, there were a lot of loc cakes

Grandma asked me to deliver them to Aunt Roi

I wanted to bring Chien along

But it was raining heavily

I put a nylon bag on his head to keep him dry

On the way, the rain fell in torrents

And the hat was effective

Chien only got wet on his nose
