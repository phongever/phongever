This morning, I walked to Su's apartment and had lunch with Gon, her and her boyfriend

I ate too much because we had ordered too many dishes

I could barely move with the full stomach

After lunch, Gon went out with his friend while Su and I was going to Lotte supermarket

Su bought her necessary things, and I bought a package of olive oil laver because the brand had promotion where customers could get a gift

Before we left, we exchange it for a nice plastic cup

At Su's apartment, I played with Rit while waiting for my phone to charge

He really liked playing with me

Afterward, I left and went to Con Market to find something for dinner

But I did not like the food there

I felt like I would get a stomachache if I ate there

So I went to the Go! supermarket in front of Con Market to find food

But I ended up eating only two sweat cakes and a dragon fruit pudding

I still did not feel satisfied

On the way back to the hotel, I found a restaurant selling fried fish cake noodle soup

I ate one bowl and finally felt full

At the hotel, while I was asking the receptionist about my booking, a woman suggested I use her room which she had paid for

I thanked her while we were in the elevator, but I still used my own room
