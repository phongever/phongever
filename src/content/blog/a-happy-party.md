This evening, I accompanied Grandma to a party celebrating her Grandmother's death anniversary

We also brought Chien along

When we got there, I walked Chien around the house hosting the party, then left him inside Grandma's brother's house to join the party with Uncle Chinh

After the party, Chien and I took a walk, and I let him meet some neighborhood dogs
