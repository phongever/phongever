This morning, Grandma, Uncle Dung, Uncle Chinh, Dad, Uncle No and I, went to Grandfather's village for a party

It's been two years since the last time we came here

During the party, Uncle Dung, Uncle Chinh and Uncle No drank a lot

Even when Grandma and Dad returned to the car, my uncles still drank with others

Dad told me to urge them to leave, but they just kept drinking

They only left when they wanted

Our relatives gave us some large bags of vegetables

However, we left them on the car until tonight

When I went to get the bags, the driver wasn't home

Later, Uncle Chinh went to pick them up

We divided the vegetables into smaller bags

I gave some to Aunt Roi, then went to the market to pick up Mom
