Grandma, Chien, and I went to the beach this morning

The sun was already high when we got there

This evening, Dad took Chien and me to visit Aunt Thuy

After coming home, Chien and I walked to my grandparents' house

Aunt Em invited us to join her family for a walk to Truong Tien Bridge

After our long walk, Chien was completely tired
