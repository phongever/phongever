I picked up Ben this evening

At my home, I gave him some cookies and took him and Chien for a walk around the neighborhood

Afterward, we went to Aunt Thuy's house

When Chien and I prepared to leave, we saw that Uncle No's brother's dog was being hit by a car

It was so horrible

Thankfully, the dog was still fine
