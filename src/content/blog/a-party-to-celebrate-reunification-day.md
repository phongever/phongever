This morning, Grandma came over to my house to watch the parade on the tv

No and Ben visited us

Afterward, Brother Set came with his wife and daughter

He caught an Uncle Chinh's chicken to prepare for the tonight party

This evening, Aunt Roi's family hosted a party to celebrate this occasion

Uncle Chinh's and Aunt Thuy's families joined

Grandma, Lom, Chien and I were also there

Chien was completely exhausted after running around Aunt Roi's house
