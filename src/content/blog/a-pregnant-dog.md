This evening, Grandma and I began our trip to visit my Grandma, Brother Gon's Grandma, and Granduncle Tue at 4:20 PM

Later tonight, Brother Gon and I watched Vietnam's match with Grandma

After the match has just finished, Dad called me about a pregnant dog in our house

She didn't want to leave

We intended to allow her to stay in our house

However, when I went to the door, she followed me and ran ahead

She leaded me to her owners

Her name is Su
