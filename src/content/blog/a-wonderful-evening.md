Aunt Thuy called me this evening, saying she couldn't find Ben anywhere and asking me to help her find him

I drove Chien around her neighborhood until nightfall, but there was no sign of him

Because it started raining, I had to stop and came home

Just before dinner, Aunt Thuy called back and excitedly informed me that Ben had just returned

What a wonderful evening!
