Grandma, my parents and I visited AEON Mall tonight

The streets were very crowed because it was Saturday, and people were going to watch the lion dance

At the mall, we just walked around the 1st floor, and took the elevator up to the 4th floor

We had planned to eat dinner at a restaurant, but some only served a buffet while others were closing

We went down to the 1st floor again

I took Grandma to a chair while my parents were buying bread

After we left the mall, we separated

My parents went to buy noodles and get gas for my motorbike, and I drove Grandma home

We arrived home earlier than my parents

Later, they got home and told us what happened

They had to stand in a long line at the gas station
