Today, I went to ViSafe to get my social insurance papers

I met Sister An, and we talked for a while

Then I went home and continued crochetting Ben's sweater

After finishing the collar, I wanted to try the sweater on Ben

Therefore, I went to Aunt Thuy's house with Chien

I also measured where I need to put the belly trap and the tail's length

Afterward, I went home

At home, Lom got angry because she thought someone had stolen Chien

Tonight, we celebrated the altar items that Uncle No had cleaned
