After work, I swung by Mom's store to deliver the motorbike

Brother Sec was already there, waiting to pick me up

He took me home

Then I took Chien for a walk

On the way, Chien became aggressive toward a neighbor's dog

I corrected him immediately

Suddenly, Aunt Thuy and Ben stopped beside us

Ben jumped off and bolted toward the neighbor's dog

Chien mirrored his aggression

I firmly grabbed his collar, commanding him to sit and stay

I told Aunt Thuy to head home and leave Ben to me

I waited for him to come back and corrected

I walked him and Chien, passing by the neighbor's dog multiple times

Whenever I felt tension on the leash, I held them back and turned away

I continued until they remained calm during our walks past the neighbor's dog
