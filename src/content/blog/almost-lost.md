This evening, Grandma and I visited Grandpa in the hospital

Uncle Mep was with him

He was feeling better

Afterward, we went to Aunt Thuy's house to pick up Ben

Back home, when I let Ben out, he ran off

Thinking he was lost, I started searching for him with Chien

Aunt Thuy joined me and found Ben near my house
