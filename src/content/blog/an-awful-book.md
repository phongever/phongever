Today, I read a book called Hypnotic Writing, and it was so awful

It felt more like a collection of blog posts than book chapters

This evening, I took Chien to the veterinarian for his annual vacination

Later, I brought Ben to my home and walked both him and Chien to my grandparent's house

Before returning Ben to his home, I gave him some cookies
