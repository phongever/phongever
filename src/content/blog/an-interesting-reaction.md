This morning, while I was eating breakfast at Aunt Hong's store, she told me a story about my parents before I was born

Mom and Dad quarreled, and Mom went hide

Then Dad and Uncle Phuc had to look for her at night

When I asked Dad and Grandma about this story, they didn't remember

Tonight, when I asked Mom the same question, Dad got angry and yelled at me

Mom even told me to forget the story because it was the past

During dinner, Dad acted strange

He said ridiculous things

I think the story is true
