I got up late and went to work late this morning

Unfortunately, my motorbike couldn't start, so I had to borrow Lom's

It was only drizzling a little

However, it started pouring, and the wind blew hard afterward

The wind got so much stronger in the afternoon

Later this evening, the wind stopped, and it was just raining softly
