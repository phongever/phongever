This morning, I returned to work

However, Lom had already done my job before I arrived

Then I went around the city to check the situation

The water was going down

But some areas were still flooded, and some, like Grandma's brother's area, did not have electricity

I then returned home

This evening, however, Lom called me to bring noodles home because the water was rapidly rising again

When I got to the market, another flood was actually happening

It was raining heavily

After bringing things home, I helped Aunt Gai prepare offerings for the altars because we would had a death anniversary tonight

Later, Uncle Chinh came home after three days spent dealing the flooding at his hotel

During dinner, Aunt Thuy and Uncle No joined us
