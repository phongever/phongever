This evening, I took Grandma to see her brother

On the way back, I saw the same dog I saw the other day

It's still in the park

After dinner, I went to the park again with Chien

That dog was lying on the grass

I called it

It left the grass and wandered around the park

I followed along and took a video of it

I posted the video on a pet rescuse group to ask for help
