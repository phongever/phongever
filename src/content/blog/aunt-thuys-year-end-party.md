This morning, I decorated my house with red lanterns and red strings, but I ran out of strings

So that, I bought a new tape and also replaced the rubber hose of my air pump this evening

Later, Dad and I went to Aunt Thuy's year-end party

After the party, I drove Uncle Chinh and Dad home, and then went to the market to pick up Mom
