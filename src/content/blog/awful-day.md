When I woke up this morning, I felt so drained with muscle soreness, a headache and a stomachache

So I worked remotely today

After lunch, I took a nap until there was a call from my colleague about a bug

I answered immediately and got up to fix the bug, then tried to nap again

I feel better after the rest

But the stomach is still hurt

Hopefully, I will feel well tomorrow
