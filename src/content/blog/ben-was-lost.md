This evening, I went to aunt Thuy's house

Uncle No said he had gone somewhere

I went back to the house to find him

I called him but nothing happened

Uncle No and his sister also went to find him

He didn't come back

I had Lom post on groups of dog lovers to find him

Aunt Thuy also posted a post

I am going to find him tomorrow
