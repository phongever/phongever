I had Uncle No fix my motorbike this morning

When I take the bike, I promised Ben to pick up him this evening

Unfortunately, it rained heavily this evening

Later, Aunt Thuy called me to pick up Ben because he had been waiting for me

I asked Lom to take Chien over to Aunt Thuy's house and let Chien him play with Ben
