Aunt Lan left this morning

Tonight, I picked Ben up and brought him home

I prepared him for to meet his mom and newborn sisters

But it started raining, so we had to wait

I fed him some bear cookies

When the rain stopped, we went to buy a new TV remote for Grandma before going to Aunt Roi's house

Ben's mom didn't seem to like him, and she even threatened him

But we still had a chance to see his sisters

They were sleeping and were so cute

Then we left and went to Mom's store

She was cleaning, and I helped her

Dad arrived, so we left

I stopped at a bookstore to buy a yarn needle, then returned Ben to Aunt Thuy
