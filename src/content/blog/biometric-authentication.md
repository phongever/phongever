This evening, I picked up Ben again

After giving him some cookies, I took him and Chien for a walk around the neighborhood

On the way, we met a new dog, and he followed along

While we were coming home, I met Dad and let him return Ben to Aunt Thuy's house

I spent the entire night completing biometric authentication for my bank accounts

I tried to find the exact placement for the tag on my ID card
