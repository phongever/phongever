I wrote some invitations for my birthday party on the 17th this morning

Then I gave two to Grandma and Uncle Chinh

This evening, Aunt Thuy called and said she would host a party to celebrate her lottery win on the same day as me

She also suggested I reschedule my party to the day after

I changed the date on the invitations to the 18th, then delivered them Aunt Roi, Mom's parents, Uncle No, and Uncle Mep

I told Grandma and Uncle Chinh about the change too

Tonight, Aunt Em called and offered to give me 1 million to help with my party's food and drinks

I accepted her offer
