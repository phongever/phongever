While I was walking around the neighborhood near my company this evening, I met the wet black dog again

He was running somewhere

Mud clung to his fur

I followed him

He ate the leftover behind a house

He seemed like a stray dog

I rushed to the nearby minimart and bought him a dried squid

But when I returned, he disappeared
