This evening, I drove Chien to aunt Thuy's house

Then we went to aunt Roi's house

I left Chien at the house and went to a pet store nearby to buy a leash

Tonight Lom came home

She bought a shirt for Chien

It was the last shirt of that size

But it was too large for him

Tomorrow I am going to find a shirt for Ben
