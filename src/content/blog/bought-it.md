This evening, I went to the pet store near my house to buy a shirt for Ben

I bought a shirt in size xl

I went to aunt Thuy's house

Her family went to a sum-up party

I went home and gave it to Chien

I took a photo and sent Lom

She said it was too tight

She went home

I, she, and Chien went to the pet store to return the shirt

Then we went to 8 stores to find the right size

Finally, we found a shirt in size 3xl for Chien
