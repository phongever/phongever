Tonight, while I was taking Chien to the gate, I accidentally dropped my phone

When I picked it up, the screen was cracked

I turned on the screen to check

It had several color lines, and it was difficult to see things and touch

I took it to a phone store

They told me to replace the screen

However, they didn't have an available screen for my phone, so I asked another store

They told me to bring it to their store tomorrow to be carefully checked
