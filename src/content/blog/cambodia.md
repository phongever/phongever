This morning, I booked a car to Tay Ninh

The driver was Sister My's friend

He took me took Suoi Sau market

We then searched for a banh trang maker village but couldn't find one

We gave up and headed towards the Moc Bai border to go to Cambodia

I got through security with a broker's help, paying over 500 thousand dongs

I felt so stupid because I could have done it myself without paying that much

Because of rumors about Cambodia, I was scared, so I stood around the border gate

I bought a SIM card and registered data, then went back to the security check

There was a long line, and the process took almost an hour

After passing through, the driver took me to Trang Bang market to buy some banh trang and a jar of shrimp salt

He then stopped at a banh canh restaurant for my lunch, which he paid for

I found this very suspicious

We returned to Sister My's house

I packed my things and took a bus to Aunt Lan's house

The trip took only two hours

It was so good to meet Aunt Lan, Uncle Hao, Vani, and Rum
