This evening, when I woke up, I saw a message from Ai Trinh asking me to check her old camera battery

Later, I went to Aunt Thuy's house with Chien

On the way, I saw Uncle Chinh at a pho store

When I arrived, I asked Uncle No about the camera

He went upstairs and searched a messy drawer, which was full of things

However, he still found the camera and its charger

I didn't know how to get the battery, so I called Ai Trinh

She told me how to open the lid

I took the battery out and started charging it

I went downstairs and played with Ben and Chien while waiting

I also measured Ben for his new sweater

Thirty minutes later, I put the battery back into the camera

It still worked perfectly

I told Ai Trinh, then took the dogs for a short walk

I returned Ben to Uncle No and went home

On the way, I saw Lom going to Uncle No's house

I yelled, but she didn't hear me, so I crossed the street and waited

Later, she met and drove us home

At home, I got off the bike, and Lom took Chien for a ride

When Mom got home, I told her about the pork head salad I saw at Uncle No's house

It looked so delicious, and I want to eat it tomorrow
