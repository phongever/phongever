This morning, my motorbike didn't start

I picked up Uncle No and took him to the market to it

However, he said the fuel filter was broken and needed replacing

I took him home, then went to the hospital to check my hand which had been bitten by Chien

It was okay

Afterward, Dad took me to the market, and I took the motorbike to the repair shop
