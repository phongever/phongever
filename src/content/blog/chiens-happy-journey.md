This morning, Grandma and I went to her village with her brother and sister-in-law for a death anniversary

We also brought Chien along

When we arrived, he was excited and explored the new place

Afterward, we left Chien with Grandma's sister-in-law and went to visit her aunt's grave

On the way, we crossed a small stream, and my shoes got wet

After the visit, we had lunch with the offerings

We then visited Grandma's cousin, who had recently had an accident

Chien went with us and ran delightly around the house

He even met other dogs in the neighborhood and ran down to the river shore

I had to bring him back home and wash the mud of his legs

It started raining, and we went home

On the way home, we visited a memorial house for someone in Grandma's family
