A drizzle this evening cooled the air after two hot days

I picked up Ben, then walked him and Chien to my grandparents' house

On our way, we met two adorable Chou Chou puppies

They were curious and sniffed Ben

Later, as we returned, we saw a big Chou Chou lying calmly behind the puppies when we passed
