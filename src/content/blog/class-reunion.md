This evening, I went to my class reunion

It was hard to book a taxi

I had Lom book a bike

The street was so crowded

It took long to get to the restaurant

They invited Mrs. Giao Tien and her husband, Mrs. Kieu Tien, and Mr. Sy

The party was really fun

After the party, I stayed with my class and chatted

Because they couldn't book a taxi

Quang Nhat booked a bike for me to go home
