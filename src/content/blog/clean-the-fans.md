This evening, I cleaned my portable fan and the one in my parents' room

Grandma and I planned to visit her brother

However, before we left, I discovered that the bike didn't have light, so I left Grandma at home and gave Chien a tour around the neighborhood

Upon our return, Dad helped me fix the bike light

Grandma and I continue our visit to her brother's house

Unfortunately, we found the door locked

We went around the city before heading back home
