I continued arguing with my colleagues about customizing components this morning

They insistently asked me to follow their code convention

But it wouldn't work properly

Arguing made my head hurt

So I changed my code as their wish

This evening I picked up Ben after work

I didn't let him go with Chien to train him to listen to me

It made some progress
