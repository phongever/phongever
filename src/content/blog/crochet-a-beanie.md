Today, I started crocheting a beanie

It was quite challenging at first because I used the half-double stitch

But after a few tries, I made some progress

This afternoon, a staff member from Grandma's hospital called Dad and asked him to take her to the hospital because insurance officers were inspecting it

Grandma had to stay at the hospital until tonight
