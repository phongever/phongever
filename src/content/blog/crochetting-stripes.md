This morning, Grandma and I had breakfast a new vegetarian restaurant because Aunt Hong had closed her shop for Tet

After that, I cleaned my computer and the desk

Later, I tried to add some yellow stripes to Chien's sweater to make them look like strings around tét cake using surface crochet today, but it was very hard and didn't match the overall design of the sweater

I am thinking about taking them out
