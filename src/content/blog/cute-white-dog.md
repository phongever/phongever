I walked Chien and Ben to the Quoc Hoc Square this evening

As soon as we arrived, a small white dog noticed and came towards us

He was so cute

The little dog followed us to shoreline before being recalled by his owner

We rested a bit on the new bridge at the shoreline, then went home

On the way, we stopped by Mom's store

Dad was already waiting for her in front of the store

Ben immediately hopped onto his motorbike, and Dad took him back to Aunt Thuy's house

Chien and I continued our walk home

He was exhausted, and even pulled the leash when seeing Dad approaching us

He quickly jumped onto the bike, and so did I

Dad drove us home before going to pick up Mom
