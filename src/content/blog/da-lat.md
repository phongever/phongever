This morning, I took a bus to Da Lat

My bunk was too small for me to lie comfortably

After 8 hours, the bus stopped at the station

I walked to my hotel, following Google Maps

It led me through alleys and hills

I met a lot of adorable dogs on the way

At the hotel, the owner accidentally forgot my booking, so she gave me a better room as compensation

I went to the night market, but it was too crowded

I left and looked for a place to eat

I ate fried rice with shredded chicken, and the price was reasonable

I walked back to the hotel, avoiding the alleys because they were slippery and dangerous in dark
