Grandmother and I had a trip to Da Nang with her brother's family today

We began our trip soon

When reaching the Hai Van Pass, we stopped for taking photos and resting

Later we visited Grandmother's sister

We left Grandmother with her sister and went to the restaurant where Brother Teen were working for lunch

Their customers were Korean tourists mostly

They served expensive Vietnamese cuisine

After lunch, I booked a Grab bike to get back to Grandmother's sister's house

I rested a bit there, then we took a taxi to Da Nang station

We got on a special train which offered tasty food and entertainment to return to Hue

I am exausted now
