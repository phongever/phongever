Tonight, Chien and I went to Aunt Roi's house to visit the puppies

Their mother dog threatened us whenever we approached her puppies

Mom suddenly called me to deliver some noodles

We left for the market and did the delivery

However, when I returned, Mom said I delivered to the wrong place

I immediately went to the wrong restaurant to get the package and brought it to the right client
