I have received admission information from some universities that are offering distance education

Most of them require students to physically take final exams at centers either in Hanoi or Saigon

That means I will have to travel a lot, which will be very expensive

There is one school in Hue offering online education, but the costs are very high, the highest among the schools I contacted

I am now looking information from other schools in Da Nang and Quang Binh

Hopefully, there will be an affordable program that doesn't require too much travel
