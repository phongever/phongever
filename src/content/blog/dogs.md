This evening, Dad and I took the motorbike to Aunt Thuy's house to have Uncle No fix the breaks

We also brought Chien along

When we arrived, Ben excitedly jumped on me and licked my mouth

Unfortunately, it's too dark for Uncle No to work on the breaks, so he scheduled the repair for tomorrow

Afterwards, I took Chien for a walk to Su's house

She ran towards us when we passed the house

Later, Lom wanted to meet Su too, so I showed her the way

After our walk, Lom saw a post on the pet rescuse group about two puppies in front of the Tu Dam agoda

We went to find them, and found them hiding under a car

Lom fed them some sausages

A environmental staff who was sweeping the road told us that the puppies had owners nearby

So we left them there
