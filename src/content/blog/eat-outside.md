This evening, when I picked up Ben, I found the tumor on his neck had grown larger

I then took him to the veterinarian

She advised that the tumor needed to be removed as soon as possible to prevent potential harm to Ben

Later, I told Aunt Thuy about this situation

Tonight, my family had dinner at the com hen restaurant owned by Mom's friend

Grandma went with us, and she also knew Mom's friend

We also brought Chien along
