Grandma and I went to GO! tonight

After getting necessary things, we went up to the third floor for a knife grinding tool

When we got to the escalator, Grandma was too afraid to step on it

But she unconsciously put her hand on the handrail, and it immediately pulled up

This surprised her and made her amlost fall backward

Luckily, I held her back, and we went up

After getting off the escalator, I took Grandma to the shoe section where had a place for people to try shoes on

I left her there, while she was selecting a pair of shoes, and went find the grinding tool

Unfortunately, that product was no sold out

I went back to Grandma

She picked out a nice pair of shoes for herself

We went down to the floor below to check out

This time, she was comfortable to use the escalator
