I walked Chien and Ben to the park this evening

On our way, we stopped by my grandparents' house

After leaving their place, we encoutered some cute dogs

At the park, we rested for a while before heading to Mom's store

Chien was exhausted and immediately lay down in front of the store

Dad took him home on his bike

I walked Ben home, and gave him some cookies before returning him
