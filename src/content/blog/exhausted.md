Today I climbed a mountain with Ka and Chien

Before the journey, I only brought half a water bottle

It ended up we didn't have enough water for three so we had to save

On the way, I kept looking around to find discarded bottles and hoped there's a little water left for Chien

Luckily, I found a small bottle with a half of water

When we finished, I let Chien drink a bowl and a half of water

He was exhasuted and so was I
