This evening, I took Chien for a walk

When we went past a house, he suddenly pulled the leash

I popped the leash and had him sit by my legs

We stood in front of that house

A man from inside went out and looked at us

Chien was scared

He even tried to hide behind me

I corrected him and made him stay by my legs

When he was calm, I walked a step forward

Chien ran in front of me

I pulled him back

I kept doing that until he could walk calmly
