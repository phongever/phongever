This morning, I saw a small white dog running around the market

I followed him a long way

Finally, he stopped at a Mom's client's noodle store

It turned out he was her dog

Tonight, we had a death anniversary

When Aunt Roi came, I told her about the puppy that I wanted to adopt

She said no because Mom doesn't want another dog

I was upset because she promised I could have it

Luckily, Uncle Chinh offered to take the puppy
