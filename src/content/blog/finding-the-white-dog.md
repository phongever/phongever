This morning, I went to my old company to get my social insurance sheet, then napped after breakfast

Tonight, I took Chien and Ben to my grandparents' house

On the way, a white dog that had followed us before joined us again

Ben, Chien, and I stayed inside the house while the dog waited outside

He even followed us on our way house

However, some neighborhood dogs threatened him, and he ran off

When I returned Ben, I looked for the white dog along the way, but I couldn't find him
