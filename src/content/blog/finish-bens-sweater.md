This morning, I wore Dad's shirt to have breakfast with Grandma because Gon was still sleeping

Then I took her to buy cough medicine

Later, Chien and I went to Aunt Thuy's house to put the sweater on Ben

It looked great on him

I finished it tonight and just need to crochet some letters

Then I went to Aunt Roi's house with Chien
