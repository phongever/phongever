This morning, a car accidentally hit me at an intersection and almost broke my leg, even though I stopped to let them pass

Luckily, I immediately screamed, and they stop just in time

I wasn't hurt, but my leg felt a bit sore

I finished the beanie tonight

I had trouble sewing the hole at the top

But I did it anyway, and the beanie looks good overall
