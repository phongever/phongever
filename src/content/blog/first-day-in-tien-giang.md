I arrived at Sai Gon early this morning

We went straight from the airport to My Tho

I was very tired and just wanted to sleep

Luckily, Uncle Map found a guesthouse, and we rested until morning

After that, we moved to another hotel

I bought some boxes of broken rice, ate lunch, and napped

Lately this afternoon, Uncle Map took us on a tour of islands on the Tien River and Ben Tre

We did many fun things and ate a lot

I was absolutely full

After taking shower, we walked to the night market
