This evening, I argued with my colleagues about the best approach for a checkbox - customing a library component or building a new one from scratch

It was hard to customize the component from the library

So I created a new one

But they insistently asked me to customize the existing component

I thought about that on my way home and came up with a potential solution

I am going to try it out tomorrow

Additionally, I made some progress on the exercise tracker project by adding controllers and components tonight
