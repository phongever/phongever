When I went to Aunt Thuy's house to pick up Ben this evening, he wagged his tail excitingly

Back at my home, I taught him to give me his hand with bear-shaped cookies and trimmed his nails

Then I walked him and Chien a walk around my neighbor

Aunt Thuy and No went to visit Grandma and took Ben home
