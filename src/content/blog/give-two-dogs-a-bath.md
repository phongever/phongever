This morning, I picked up Ben and brought him home

Then I gave him and Chien a bath

Ben stayed with me until tonight

After returning him to his home, Dad and I drove Chien around the city

I also finished crochetting the scarf

It looks ugly, but it is still warm

Grandma, my parents and Lom tested it
