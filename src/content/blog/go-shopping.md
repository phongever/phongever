After work, I swung by the supermarket to buy a jar of pineapple jam

While I was there, I also bought a new pair of earphones

Because my old ones were on the fritz

Then I went to pick up Ben

On the way home, I stopped by the pet store to buy shampoo for Chien and a new jingle bell for Ben's collar
