This morning, I went to Aunt Thuy's house to ask Uncle No for a black tape to cover a burned hole on the kettle's base

However, he didn't have any tape, but he suggested using plastic weld

I came home and brought the base back to Uncle No

Chien also came with me

Uncle No filled the hole with a small piece of plastic

He even ground down the plastic fill to make it smoother afterward

The kettle stood stably on the base now

After my nap this evening, Grandma told me to take the dustspan to Uncle No, so he could fix the steel wire

He replaced the wire with two screws
