This morning, I took Chien to Mom's parents' house to let him play with Aunt Ty's children

Then I went to Aunt Hong's store to have breakfast and headed to the coffee shop where Gon was working

It was his first day, and he served tea to the customers

Later, I bought Mom a cup of coffee, but she didn't drink coffee

So I gave it to Uncle Tem and picked up Chien

Tonight, Chien and I went to Aunt Roi's house, and we played with the puppies

They played and chewed things around the house

When they were tired, they went to their corner and slept
