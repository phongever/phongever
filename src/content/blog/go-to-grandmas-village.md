This morning, I attended a big death anniversary at Grandma's village with her, Aunt Lan, Uncle Dung, Uncle No, Dad, Brother Pha and Lom

After the party, Brother Pha and I walked to my great grandfather's house while the rain getting heavier

Fortunately, the gate wasn't locked

Lom also came soon after

Later, Dad and others came to pick us up, and we went home

Tonight, we had another party

Uncle Dung was too tired after the afternoon's celebration, so he stayed and slept at Grandma's house

Aunt Thuy's family stayed too

They even played cards until 11 PM
