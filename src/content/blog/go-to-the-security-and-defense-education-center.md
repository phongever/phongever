This morning, I drove Aunt Gai and Chien to visit Gon at the Security and Defense Education Center

We got lost, so it took a long time to get there

Aunt Gai was so happy to see Gon

Gon's walking hadn't improved

He was still limping

We planned to go out and eat bun bo

However, the guard did not permit, so we went to the canteen instead

Gon ordered instant noodles with beef and a sausage
