This morning, I went to Mom's village with Grandpa, my parents, and Uncle Mep for a death anniversary

After we arrived, I went to the beach

It was sunny, and the beach was calm

I played for a while, then had lunch before going home

Tonight, I took Grandma to GO!

We bought milk, yogurt, jam and two moon cakes

I also bought three yogurt packs to get a free gift, a beautiful green bowl
