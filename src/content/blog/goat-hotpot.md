This evening, I went to Aunt Thuy's house after work

No one was at home

I called Ben

Ben came downstairs

I brought him to my home

I gave him some crackers but he didn't eat

He played with Chien

After a while, he wandered around Grandmother's house and whined

Dad told me that Aunt Thuy called

She was looking for Ben

After exercise, I returned him back to his home

Tonight, my family ate goat hotpot to celebrate Women's Day
