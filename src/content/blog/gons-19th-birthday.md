This morning, I took Ka to AEON Mall for fries

I asked Khai Minh and Minh Anh if they wanted to join, but they didn't want to

On the way, I stopped by Aunt Hong's store for breakfast and then the bank to deposit the money I had exchanged to my account

After getting the fries, I bought yogurt, milk and cereal for Grandma

We also bought a coin cake at the bakery

The second and third floors are open at 10AM, so we waited for 30 minutes

Once it opened, we went to the grocery store upstairs

There were a lot of interesting things there

Then Ka and I went home

Aunt Gai invited me to Gon's birthday dinner

Tonight, I took Grandma to Aunt Gai's house and ate thick noodle soup with goat meat

Later, I ate pork head salad and sticky rice at home
