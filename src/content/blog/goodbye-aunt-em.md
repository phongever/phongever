This morning, we went to the death anniversary of Uncle Tai's father and ate lunch there

Afterward, we headed to Aunt Loan's house in Sai Gon to wash our dirty clothes

We then visited Aunt Em's friends before going back to Aunt Loan's house to pick up the clothes

Next, we visited another friend of Aunt Em, where I met Uncle Tan

He took Rooney somewhere

After that visit, Aunt Em's friends took us to the airport, where Uncle Map was waiting for us

Uncle Tan and Rooney also arrived

We said goodbye to Aunt Em's family

After they went through the security, Uncle Tan took me to Sister My's house

On the way, we stopped at a noodle restaurant for dinner
