This morning, I went to the hospital to get my foot's numbness checked, which I have noticed for over a week

While waiting for my blood test results, I walked to Aunt Thuy's house and played with Ben

WHen I got the results, I saw that my uric acid was high

The doctor said I have gout

It's so rediculous because I always eat healthy

Now I need to be careful
