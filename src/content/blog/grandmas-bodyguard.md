I took Mom to her brother's house for her grandfather's death anniversary this afternoon

Then I left her there and went home to nap

Later this evening, Chien and I went to the anniversary

When we got to the house, we saw a neighbor's dog

He had come with his owner

However, I did not know that and let him outside, then closed the door

Chien ran around the house and followed Grandma everywhere, just like her bodyguard
