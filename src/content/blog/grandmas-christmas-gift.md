Today, I gave Grandma a Christmas gift

It was the beanie that I mad over the last few days

This afternoon, I attended the death anniversary for Aunt Gai's father

After the party, someone accidentally took Dad's helmet

Dad thought Uncle Dung may have taken it, so we went to his house tonight

He actually took the helmet because he was very drunk and couldn't even stand up properly

He had just arrived at home

I also saw the puppies

They were eating bear-shaped cookies

On the way home, Dad coughed a lot and was tired, so I picked Mom up tonight

Fortunately, he still had dinner with us
