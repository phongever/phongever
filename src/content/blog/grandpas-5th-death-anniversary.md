It has been five years since Grandpa's death

This morning, my family held an anniversary celebration

We went his grave to clean and pull weeds

The party was really fun when our relatives joined

Tonight, my family had dinner together

Other members left early because they were exhausted after days of preparing for Grandpa's death anniversary
