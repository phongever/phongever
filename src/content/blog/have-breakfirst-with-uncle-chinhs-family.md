This morning, while I was preparing to go buy breakfast, Uncle Chinh invited me to join his family

I agreed and drove Brother Gon and Chien

We went to a pho shop on Tran Thuc Nhan street

But it was closed because the owner was in the hospital

We went to another one on Lich Doi street and had breakfast

Later, I took Brother Gon to the old way that I used to go home from my extra class in 5th grade

On the way, we found a busy organ porridge shop

I forgot the way because it looks very different now

I asked people for directions and finally reach the path behind Van Phuoc pagoda

It was so nostalgic

When we came home, Mom called me to deliver noodles, but Lom already did it

So I took Chien to Aunt Thuy's house to play with Ben
