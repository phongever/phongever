This morning, my father went to see a doctor

He has coughed since last Wednesday

He went home, took medicine, and then went to bed

I drove Chien to buy lunch

I bought two boxes, one for me and one for Gon

This evening, I cleaned my fans and grandmother's fans

Then I went to the pet store

On the way, I helped an environmental staff push his garbage cart

I went to the store and bought a leash for Chien

I didn't like it, so returned it
