Tonight my family had a party

As always, Aunt Thuy brought Ben along

I walked him and Chien around the neighborhood

During our walk, we met the neighbor's white dog

Chien lunged aggressively

Ben mirrored his aggression

I immediately corrected them and asked them to sit and stay

The white dog watched us from a distance

Unfortunately, the peace was short-lived

Chien suddenly lunged again and Ben followed suit

Ben's leash tightened around my hand, causing pain in my palm and fingers

I punished them and walked them around the white dog to train them to focus me on instead of the dog
