After topping off the tires at Uncle No's house, I found Ben waiting for me, excitedly jumping on my bike

So I brought him along

Back home, I walked him and Chien around the neighborhood

After our walk, I left them in the yard to play

But Ben continuously whined to go outside

He even tried jumping the fence

I immediately stopped him from doing that
