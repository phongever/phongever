Tonight, Mom asked me to bring her some fried purple onion

I called Chien to come with me

However, I couldn't put the onion in the trunk due to an oil leak

So, I put them in front of me, where Chien had been sitting, and left him home

After returning, I kept my promise and walked Chien to grandmother's house

There was a party there, and he didn't want to leave
