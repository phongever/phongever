After lunch, I borrowed Uncle Hao's bike and went to La Gi

On the way, I ran out of gas

I took the bike to a gas station

However, it was closed for maintenance

I asked two girls selling fruit in front of the station to help me buy gas

They agreed

I bought their bananas

I continued my trip to visit Uncle Lam and his sister

After the visit, I headed to La Gi

I stopped at a supermarket to rest, then went back to Aunt Lan's house
