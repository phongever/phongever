This morning, Dad's motorbike had a flat tire

He used my motorbike to ship noodles, and I used Lom's

After work, Dad took the motorbike to Uncle No's store to fix it

I then went there to give Dad my motorbike

He went home while I was waiting for the tire to get patched

I measured Ben's body

Once Uncle No fixed the tire, I went home and started making Ben's sweater

His body is longer than I estimated, and the yarn I have is not enough
