I plan to start learning Chinese and knitting next month

Actually, I was going to take the IELTS exam next month for my admission, but I have to change that plan

I am interested in Chinese because I want to understand the Chinese cartoons that I am watching

Regarding knitting, I want to learn it so I can make Christmas gifts for Grandma and Chien
