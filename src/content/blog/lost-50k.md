This morning, Grandma and I went to her village with Uncle Kien and her wife for a death anniversary and a longevity celebration

When we arrived, we visited our ancestors' graves and met Grandma Hanh's family on the way

Tonight, I continued playing cards with Lom, Gon, Su and her cousin

I only bet 50k but lost it all

I even borrowed 100k from Lom but still could pay her back, even though I lost a lot
