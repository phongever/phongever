Today, while I was going to work, both sidewalks were full of flowers and trees

Especially big pots of peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, and kumquats

They are the sign of the Lunar New Year

Tonight, I changed the learning English method

I learned by heart a post and speak it without looking at the screen
