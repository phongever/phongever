This evening, I went to aunt Thuy's house

Ben wanted to go with me

But aunt Thuy needed to wash him first

I waited for Ben to be washed

Then I took him to my house

I took him and Chien for a walk to Quoc Hoc Square

We saw two big dragons

I took them to my house, and I drove Ben to aunt Thuy's house

It was difficult to walk them but fun
