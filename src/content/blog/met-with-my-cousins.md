This morning, while I was leaving work, Ka came with Aunt Ty's son

They just had finished breakfast at Aunt Hong's shop

I went there and met Uncle Tem and Aunt Ty's family

She looked weak and old

Tonight, Aunt Roi called to ask if I still wanted to adopt one of her puppies

I said yes and am going to pick it up tomorrow

Later, I argued with Grandma because she kept mentioning strangers while blaming her family members
