I had mixed feelings today

This morning, I saw an abandoned puppy on the sidewalk in front of Mom's store

I shared videos of it in a pet rescue group to get help

Two people contacted me and wanted to adopt the puppy

I gave them the dog's information and location

However, when I went to the market this evening, the puppy was still there

I contacted one of the two people and urged her to hurry

She told me to wait for her

Later, she came and picked up the puppy

When she got home, she sent me photos of the puppy smiling

I felt so happy

But after dinner, I saw my neighbor looking for his white Pomeranian

His family searched the neighborhood for their dog

I also walked around with Chien to help them, but we could not find their dog

It was sad
