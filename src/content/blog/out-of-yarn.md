This morning, I went to Winmart to look for a new razor blade, but they did not have what I wanted

I stopped by Aunt Thuy's house for a bit

Uncle No looked so young

He dyed his hair and shaved his beard

This evening, I continued working on my beanie and ran out of yarn

I will buy a new ball of yarn tomorrow
