Today, I attended my great grandfather's death anniversary

As the party started, I sat with my two cousins, and we had to eat a meal meant for ten people

After the first course, I was full, but still wanted to taste the subsequent dishes

I ate each a bit

As a result, my stomach was like a balloon, and I ate very little tonight
