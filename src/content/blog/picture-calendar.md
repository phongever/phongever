This morning, I had breakfast at Aunt Hong's store with Grandma, Aunt Gai and her mom

While we were waiting for the food, we met Grandmother Hien and Aunt Ty's family coming to the store

They had breakfast with us, and then Aunt Ty paid for us

After breakfast, I delivered noodles and stopped by Aunt Roi's house

Uncle Dung's brother was getting a puppy

There was only one left

Mom called me to deliver noodles again

After work, I went home to help Grandma with her calendar

However, the board didn't have holes for the calendar

I didn't want to manually make the holes myself, so I asked Mom if I could change to another type

She said yes

I took the calendar to Ben Ngu market, but the seller only had one kind

I returned it and looked for a new one on Shopee

There were many different types

I bought a beautiful and modern picture calendar
