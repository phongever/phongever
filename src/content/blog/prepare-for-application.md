I found a university that offers affordable distance programs and is not too far

It is Dong Thap University

They do not have computing programs, but they do have business administration

Their credits only cost 300.000 dong

I only have to go to Quang Ngai to take the semester's final exam

I asked the admission staff about the program syllabus and gave her my high school transcript
