I went to the supermarket to buy butter and cheese for the spaghetti this morning, preparing for the birthday party

When checking out, the cashier did not have enough change because I only had two 500.000 notes that Mom gave me as Aunt Em's contribution

I had to pay with cash

The same issue happened at the parking lot

However, this time, the guard let me go without paying the 2.000 parking fee
