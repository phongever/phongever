This morning, I met Uncle Dung at Mom's store

He told me the puppies were gone

In the afternoon, while I was sleeping, Lom made noise, making me wake up

I asked her to keep silent, but she said this was her revenge for me because I did the same to her last night

However, it was just an accident, and I appologized her for that

Tonight, I took Ben to Uncle Dung's house to ask him about the puppies

One puppy was given away to a Uncle Dung's relative while the other was stolen

It was very sad
