This morning, I went to GO! to find a new razor blade

I saw many options with different brands and types, but I wasn't sure which one fit my razor

So I bought a Dorco, the brand I am using, and a Gillette, a more expensive one,

Luckily, they both fit

On the way home, I stopped at a bookstore to buy some yarn

Later, I found some Gillette razors in the kitchen closet

I collected and put them in my closet
