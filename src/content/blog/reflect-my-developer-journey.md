I want to spend some time today reflecting on my developer journey

Honestly, I have not been a developer for most of my career

During the Covid-19 pandemic, I switched to being a YouTuber but did not succeed

Then I returned to the developer route with an intern position and finally got a full-time job

But my salary was low, only half of what I made before the pandemic

After my intern contract expired, I changed company, hoping to increase my salary

However, the salary remained the same, and the working conditions at the new company were even worse than the previous one

Moreover, I was laid off by them later

I want to continue as a developer, but there are only a few open jobs in Hue currently, and they do not require my tech stack

If this continues, I may have to change my job, but I still do not know what to do
