This morning, I took my pants to get the loose waistbands fixed

I have a lot of troubles wearing them every day

Tonight, I checked the tuition fees for Master's programmes at Finnish universities and financial requirements to apply for a residence permit in Finland

I was really shocked by what I saw

There are no longer any scholarships for first-year international students

Universities only offer an early bird discount of 2.000 euros

Worse, the required amount of money for the residence permit has been raised to almost 10.000 euros

That is so expensive
