I picked up Ben after work

As we arrived at my home, I reset my phone to try to fix the sound recorder's glitch

After resetting, I still got the same issue

It turned out the recorder was conflicting with another app

If I turned off that app, it would cause the glitch

So I have to keep it on to fix the issue

When I returned Ben, it was raining
