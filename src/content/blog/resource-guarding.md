Tonight, my family gathered for a pigs' trotter party

After work, I planned to stop by Aunt Thuy's house to inflate my tires

I also intended to pick up Uncle No and Ben and bring them home

But he had already gone

I went to my house

Everyone was already there

Aunt Thuy also had brought Ben along

He was playing with Chien

I went to inflate my tires then headed to my mom's store

I gave her the key and went home with Aunt Thuy

During the party, Chien didn't let Ben eat trotters

He would stare and growl whenever Ben approached the food

They eventually fought
