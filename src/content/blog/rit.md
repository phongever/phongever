Today, our family, Grandma, Uncle Chinh and his wife, Uncle No, and I, went to Da Nang for a relative's wedding

Before coming to the restaurant hosting the party, we stopped by Su's room

A dog named Rit lying outside the room came toward and greeted us

He is the department owner's dog

Rit was so adorable

He even jumped up on me and whined with excitement

No then joined us, and we all headed to the party

Afterward, we brought Rit some chicken bones and two boxes of yogurt
