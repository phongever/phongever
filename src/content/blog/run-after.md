I picked up Ben this evening

Then we went to Aunt Roi's house to deliver Aunt Thuy's chung cakes

Back at my home, I gave Ben some cookies

He ate all and then darted out the door with Chien

A neighbor's dog startled Ben, making him run into the street

I followed and took him back

At my home, I taught him to come, but when I opened the door, he bolted back into the street again

I brought him back and locked him in

Before returning him to Aunt Thuy, I gave him a few more cookies
