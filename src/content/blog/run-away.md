This evening, during our walk, Chien and I passed Tu Van Pagoda

Suddenly, a dog ran out from the grounds of the pagoda and barked at Chien

He was scared

I attempted to calm and make him sit

But I, unfortunately, unlocked the collar

Chien bolted away

I chased after him but he was fast

He ran toward home

I finally caught him

We practiced walking calmly around the neighborhood
