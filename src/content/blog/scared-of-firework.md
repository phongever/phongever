I picked up Ben after work

While we were at home, he suddenly bolted when he heard fireworks exploding in the distance

I searched the neighborhood until I spotted him running towrads me from the road

I brought him along on my trip to Aunt Roi's house, where he met his mother and grandfather

Later, I returned him to Aunt Thuy's house
