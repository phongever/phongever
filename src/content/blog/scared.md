When I prepared to finish work, Dad called and told me to deliver the bike to Mom's store

It was so crowded

Aunt Thuy had been waiting for me with Chien

After dropping the bike, we went home

Later, I went to her house to pick up Ben

Back home, I took him for a walked

When we reached the street, he panicked because of vehicles and peoples

He even tried to escape

I grabbed his collar and pushed him to sit

I waited for him to be calm before continuing our walk
