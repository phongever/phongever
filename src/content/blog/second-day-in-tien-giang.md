This morning, we took Uncle Tai's ash to Ben Tre

After we got back, we had lunch at a restaurant

I ate a lot of vegetables

I then napped until the evening

Uncle Tai's sister took us to a bun mam restaurant

After the dinner, we went to a supermarket

We then returned to the hotel and sat outside for some fresh air
