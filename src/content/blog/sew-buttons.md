This morning, I took Ben home again

Dad asked me to sew the buttons on his pyjama

I watched tutorials on how to do that and did it perfectly

Later, Aunt Thuy came and brought Ben home

Dad invited her to have dinner with us

Tonight, Aunt Roi and her family also came

After the party, Lom roasted a dried squid and fed a little bit to Chien
