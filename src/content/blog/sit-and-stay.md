Today is the last day of my vacation

This evening, I went to aunt Thuy's house with Chien to inflate the tires

Chien saw a dog from the other side of the street

He pulled the leash

I pulled him back and asked him to sit and stay

He sat but still tried to cross the street

I kept him to stay

He stayed for a long time

I also made Ben sit because he still didn't listen to me
