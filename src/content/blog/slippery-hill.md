This morning, Grandma and I went back to the post office for her social benefits

However, this will only start in January

Past benefits will still be paid in cash

Later, I took Grandma to Van Phuoc pagoda for a death anniversary

While I was going up a hill, my motorbike suddenly slipped

Luckily, I kept my balance, and Grandma was still fine
