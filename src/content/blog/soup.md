After work, I picked up Ben from Aunt Thuy's house

Back home, I practice walking on a leash with him

He still knew when I stopped and sat when I asked

But he still often got distracted

Before returning Ben, Dad gave me a box of soup for Aunt Thuy

I delivered both Ben and the soup to my aunt's house

Later, she and Uncle No came by to return the box
