This evening, I drove Ben to my home

Before letting him get on and get off the scooter, I told him to sit and stay

When I said ok, he jumped on and jumped off

When I took him for a walk, he didn't come when I called

I trained him at home but he still didn't come

I had to grasp his collar and bring him back

Today my moms bought 2 coats, 1 shirt, and 1 pant

I brought Dad's mother a coat

I will also bring Mom's dad the remaining tomorrow
