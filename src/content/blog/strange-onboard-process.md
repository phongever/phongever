Today is my first working day at the new company

It was the strangest experience I've had

They didn't prepare anything for my onboard

When I arrived at the office, hr representative wasn't there

The technical leader took me to a workspace where desktop, keyboard, mouse and chair were covered by dust

The computer screen was even broken, having some lines on the screen

They replaced it with another one

In the morning, I just reviewed their product's storyboard in Figma

Until the evening, I had a meeting with the dev team

I have to develop with Nodejs and Laravel

But it's difficult to set up the environment because of the outdated document
