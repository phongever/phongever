This afternoon, Uncle Chinh and I went to Grandfather Ty's and his wife's death anniversary

I ate a lot there

After the party, I offered to drive Uncle Chinh home because he was drunk, but he insisted on driving me

When we reached the old elementary school, we saw Grandma, who had gone with Aunt Phuong, walking with Gon

I got off and helped her get home

Tonight, I continued working on Chien's sweater but had trouble with the armholes

The markers I put for the holes were in the wrong spot for Chien's legs
