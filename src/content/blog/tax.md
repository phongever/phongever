This evening, I received a call from the tax office informing me that I needed to update my tax identity information to proceed with my tax return

I visited the tax office's website, but my information wasn't found in the national database

The system even allowed only three attempts to update the information

So I'll try again tomorrow

After work, I walked Chien to buy an electric plug
