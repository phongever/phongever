This morning, I worked as usual

However, Lom called me later to take her motorbike home because the river's water level was rising

When I arrived at the market, the water was past the sidewalk

I rode the motorbike home and had lunch

Afterward, Lom called again, this time asking me help move goods home because the water was approaching Mom's stall

Dad and I went to the market

We had to walk in knee-high water to bring things home

The water kept rising

Everyone had to move their stalls up to the bridge

Things got chaotic

Mom and Lom left the market early

After dinner, we went to the market again

The water was even reaching the bridge
