This evening, while walking around the building, I saw the black dog playing with another across the street

I watched them playing

Then the black dog saw and ran toward me, then followed around

Later Grandma and I visited went to Aunt Thuy's house to inflate the tires

Ben excitedly greeted us

From there, we headed to Grandma's brother's house, but no one was at home
