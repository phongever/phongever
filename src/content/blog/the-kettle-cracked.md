This morning, I placed the kettle on the kitchen cabinet

While I was sweeping the floor, the kettle unexpectedly fell and cracked

This evening, I went to the store to buy a new one

Interestingly, a staff member at the store advised me to leave a small amount of water in the kettle after boiling to prevent the bottom from burning
