When I arrived at the office this morning, I found everyone was standing outside

We went downstairs to the minimart to wait for a colleague who had the key

Once he arrived, we entered the office, which felt like a sauna

I tried using a portable air conditioner, but it didn't make much of a difference

We eventually had to open the doors for some relief

Luckily, it started raining later in the evening
