Tonight, we went to watch the lion dance again

Luckily, we saw some groups along the way

Before going home, we went to some moon cake shops

We have eaten vegetarian cakes this Mid-Autumn Festival, and they were very sweet

We wanted a moon cake with meat, but they were expensive

So we decided to buy a cheaper one at the market

Later, Aunt Roi and Aunt Thuy came over with their husbands

After dinner, I cut the moon cake

It was my last one this festival, and it was less sweet and more delicious
