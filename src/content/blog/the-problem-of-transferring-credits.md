title: The problem of transferring credits

Today, I learned the hard truth that my Bachelor's degree might not be valid for Master's applications

Because the tution fees and living costs in Finland are too high, I changed my mind and checked the admission information for Master's programmes in Taiwan instead

There is a rule requiring the insitution which awarded my degree must be accredited

Even the insitution from which I transfered credits must also follow this requirement

However, I transfered some credits from Sophia which is just a service, not an accredited institution

That means I am not going to be able to apply for Master's programmes in Taiwan

My degree is also not valid in Vietnam because UoPeople is not recognized here

That's why I am thinking about studying another online Bachelor's degree in information technology at a university in Hue
