HAPPY LUNAR NEW YEAR

This morning, my family went to mom's village

It was really cold and rainy

The street was deserted

I went to the beach

After having lunch, I realized that I had lost my voice

This afternoon, the driver allowed me to take Chien with us

My grandmother and my family went to the family members' houses

This evening, we had dinner with aunt Thuy's family

Then we played cards

I played on behalf of brother Son and lost all of his money
