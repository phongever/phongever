This evening, while I was sitting on the chair on Grandma's porch, the armrest suddenly fell off

The screw was loose

I tried to tighten the screw, but I did not have the right screwdriver

I planned to borrow one from Uncle No

Luckily, Dad was bringing food to Lom, so I went with him and Chien

Afterward, we went to Aunt Thuy's house

I borrowed Uncle No's screwdriver and walked Chien home

At home, I tightened the armrest, and it is steady now
