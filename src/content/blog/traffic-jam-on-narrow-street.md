This morning, I was stuck in a traffic jam in front of University of Medicine and Pharmacy while delivering uot cakes

The street was so narrow, and everyone was trying to get to school and work on time

But the more people tried to do that, the worse the congestion they caused

I finnaly managed to get out of the jam and delivered the cakes, then avoided the traffic by going another way
