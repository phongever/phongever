This evening, while walking Chien, I took off his leash to let him play

When I called him back, he started to walk away, uninterested in returning

I calmly followed him to bring him back

But he still walked forward to the street

I stepped back a bit and waited for him

Once he returned and was close, I grasped his collar and redirected him back to where I initially called him

On the way back home, I continued practicing his recall command
