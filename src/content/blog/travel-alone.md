This moring, Grandma and I attended a death anniversary in the village with her brother and sister-in-law

After the celebration, I helped Grandma's brother and his wife clean up the house because of the flooding

After finishing the work, we went home, and I took a nap

When I woke up, I booked a taxi to Da Nang because Su could not help me

She worried about my Mom, who did not want me to go to Da Nang with Gon

I got to Da Nang, ate delicious fried sticky rice with shredded chicken for dinner, and then booked a room at a hotel near Su's apartment
