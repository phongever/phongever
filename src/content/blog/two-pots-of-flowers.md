This morning, I cleaned my slippers and my fans as well as Grandma's fans

Tonight, Dad and I went to a flower shop next to Aunt Thuy's house to buy two pots of flowers

The shop asked for 250k each, which was too much

Uncle No promised to help us buy at a better price

Later, Uncle No called us to get them for 180k

Then, I started crochetting the text "Bình An" and "Đong Đầy" onto Ben's sweater
