Today, I met the stray black dog that usually wandered around my company

He was lying on the sidewalk and looking tired

I ran to the minimart, and bought two sausages and a dried squid

I returned and fed him a sauge and the squid

He didn't like the squid but devoured the sausage

I left him there and went back to the office

Later this evening, I met him again

I fed him the remaining sausage

Aftward, he followed me while I was walking

After work, I pickup Ben

At home, I fed him some cookies, then I brought him to Aunt Roi's house to met his mom
