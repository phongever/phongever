This morning, it was pouring rain while I was taking Grandma to the hospital

Water was starting to cover the streets

I struggled to find the way home

When I got to Mom's store, the river was approaching the sidewalk

Later, the water rose quickly, and Lom called me to take her motorbike home

Fortunately, it stopped raining, and the water is slowly declining
