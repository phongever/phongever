I made a mistake while crocheting, so I had to undo the yarn

Unfortunately, the yarn turned into a big mess

I have been spending the whole day untangling it, but I'm still not finished

Today, after saying goodbye to Jadin, my parents and Lom went home with Brother Pha

Tonight, we had a party to welcome him and Lom's friends, who arrived in Hue last night
