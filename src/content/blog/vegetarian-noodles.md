This morning, I started my routine of buying breakfast myself on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday

After finishing my work, I went to Aunt Thuy's house and unexpectedly met the son of Mrs.Binh, my old literature teacher

We had a short talk

Then Aunt Thuy asked me to bring Ben home

I took him home, then drove Grandma to buy a chair

I left Grandma at the store and took clothes to Mom's mother for drying

After carefully considering, Grandma finally chose her chair

We went to a nearby pagoda, where we met two nuns

While we were talking, Mom called me to deliver noodles, so I left Grandma with her chair at the pagoda

On the way delivering noodles, I stopped at Aunt Hong's store and bought a box of vegetarian noodles

When I finished my work, I picked up Grandma and her chair, then we went home

Aunt Hong's pho was delicious

Because Ben missed Aunt Thuy and Uncle No, he kept whining

Later, Aunt Thuy was worried about Ben, so she went to pick him up
