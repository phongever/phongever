Tonight, we had a goodbye party for Aunt Ty's family at a vegetarian restaurant

The food was very good, and I ate a lot

Later at home, I asked Mom, "Why don't you let me have the Aunt Roi's puppy?"

She said, "Because Grandma doesn't want to have a girl dog in the house."

"What if I still want her, " I continued

"Then do what you want," Mom responded

Then Gon and I went to Grandma's house, but Lom didn't allow us to enter

She even told us to leave

So, we played at Gon's house instead
