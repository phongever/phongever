I went to Aunt Thuy's house after work to pick up Ben

He was nowhere to be found

I went to the backyard

It was empty

I went to wait at the front door

No sign of him

I went behind the house again and called him

The sound of the bell rang from somewhere

He ran toward me and wagged his tail excitedly
