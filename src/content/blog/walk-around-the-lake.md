After breakfast, I returned to the hotel to watch MSI

After the match, I went to Xuan Huong Lake and walked around it

The lake is next to Da Lat market, so I visited the market and had lunch

I also bought a glass of avocado ice cream

Later, I went back to the hotel

On the way, it dirzzled for a bit

At the hotel, I slept until 6 PM, then went out for dinner

On the way back to the hotel, I stopped at a bakery and bought a cake for tommorrow
