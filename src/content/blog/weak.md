I received a box of beer from company as a Tet gift this evening

Afterward, I went to pick up Ben

Because he vomited last night, Aunt Thuy wouldn't let me take him home

I went home and brought Chien to Aunt Thuy's house

Then I took both of them for a walk around the neighborhood

During our walk, Lom arrived

I returned Ben to Aunt Thuy and carried Chien to Lom's motorbike

He hadn't never stood on the motorbike before so it's quite difficult

Finally, he was could lie between Lom and me, and we went home together
