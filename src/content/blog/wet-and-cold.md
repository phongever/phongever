Grandma and I attended her brother's death anniversary this evening

After the party, we visited Brother Gon's grandmother who was hospitalized

However, on our way, a heavy downpour unexpectedly began

I stopped and helped Grandma put on her raincoat

Unfortunately, I had left mine at home, so I got drenched in the sudden rain

It was so cold
