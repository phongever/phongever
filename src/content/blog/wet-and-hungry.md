Today I met a dog standing in the rain

When I got closer, he waged his tail and bow at me

He had already get wet

I looked around to find his owner but no one seem to be looking for him

Whenever he saw someone was bringing food, he followed them and sniffed at their food

I followed him

He looked back and excitedly ran in front of me

I went down to the basement to get my motorbike

The dog ran after me, but the guard stopped him

After getting my motorbike, I went to a mini mart and bought him a cake and a bag of dried squid

I looked for him around the area but he was nowhere to be found

In the afternoon, I continued the search, but still couldn't find him
