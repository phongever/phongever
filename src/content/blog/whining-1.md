This evening, I picked up Ben

Aunt Thuy and Uncle No had to attend a funeral so they would arrive home late

She asked me to keep Ben at my home until she called

Ben stayed at my home and played with Chien for a while

Then he kept whining, wanting to go home

I waited for Aunt Thuy's call and returned him
