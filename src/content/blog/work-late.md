This morning, I woke up and went to work late, so Dad got angry

While delivering goods, my motorbike broken down, and I had to push it all the way to the market

After resting for a while, I took it to the fixing store

I walked back to Mom's store, grabbed a package of sandwiches and went home

Once my motorbike was fixed, Dad gave me a ride to the store

I went home to picked up Chien and then headed to Aunt Roi's house to get Grandma's helmet

This afternoon, Mom gave me $100, a gift from Aunt Ty

Tonight, Lom exchanged $100 to VND for me
