This morning, I wrote and delivered some invitations for Grandma's birthday

This evening, I got a new haircut, shaving my head

Chien followed me to the barber, but a nearby white dog scared him off, and he ran away

I also saw two new dogs at the house where the small white dog and his brother lived

Later, I took Grandma and Chien to visit a relative
