From today, I am going to start writing the journal in English

It could be hard

But I will try my best to get band 7 in IELTS

This evening, I took Chien for a walk

My hand is still hurt

Tonight I ate so much

I ate two bowls of rice, two bowls of soup, almost a dish of banh loc, and three pieces of fried banana cake

I am so full
