A: What is a habit?

B: Scientists define habits as behaviors that are performed regularly and cued subconsciously in response to certain environments, whether be a location, time of day, or even an emotional state. They can include simple actions like picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained in daily routines like staying up late or brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently without much deliberation, then it's likely a habit

A: How can that happen?

B: They form because at some point your brain learns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email, you bite your nails. This is rewarding, as it's enough to focus your attention, curbing your email-fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates feeling of pleasure

A: What is the role of dopamine?

B: Dopamine is also a driver of neuroplasticity, meaning it can change how your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections that link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior with other cues like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context of sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger a nail-biting habit, no stressful email or sense of relief required

A: I will perform a habit without noticing what I am doing in, am I?

B: Once established, these cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself engaging in a habit before you have the chance to notice and stop. But this can be a good thing because not all habits are bad

A: Why is that?

B: They're stored memories of what worked in the past, which allow you to take swift action in the present

A: So I can change the current habits

B: Yes. Habits are often cued by environments and routines. One of the most effective ways to manage behavior is to identify the locations or times of day, then try to modify them by changing your routine or creating obstacles that make it more difficult to perform the habit in that space

A: How can I do that?

B: Moving, switching jobs, or even starting a new schedule are particularly great times to break a habit or build a new one. There is a practice called habit reversal training. It aims to change the habit by replacing it with another one that's less detrimental

A: How does it work?

B: The training requires you to analyze and understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene at the right times. For example, if you tend to bite your nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy at your desk. Then if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel the urge to bite your nails

A: How long can I break a habit?

B: Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace and patience through the process. You should also celebrate the good habits, that help you move swiftly and successfully through your daily routines
