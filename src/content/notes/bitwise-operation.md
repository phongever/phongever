## & (AND)

Return `1` if both compared bits are `1`

Return `0` in other cases

## | (OR)

Return `1` if there is at least `1` bit

Return `0` if both bits are `0`

## ! (NOT)

Revert `1` to `0` and vice versa

Return a negative number in **two's compliment arithmethic**

## ^(XOR)

Return `1` when there is only a single `1`

## Shifting operators

`>>`: shift all bits of a number to the right `n` times. Fill empty bits in positive number with `0`s and negative number with `1`s

`<<`: shift to the left. Empty bits will be filled with `0`s
