A: What is confidence?

B: Confidence is the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable. It is also known as self-esteem. It adds in the optimism that comes when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these to act courageously to face a challenge head-on

A: So where does confidence even come from?

B: There are several factors that impact confidence. One, what you were born with, such as your genes which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in your brain. Two, how you treat it. This includes the social pressures of your environment. Three, the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factors, but the personal choices we make certainly play a major role in confidence development

A: Are there any practical tips to cultivate my own confidence?

B: Yes. The first tip is trying a quick fix. You picture your success when you are beginning a difficult task. You can listen to music with deep bass. It will promote your feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose or give yourself a pep talk

A: This tip is easy to do. I also sometimes picture my success when I do difficult tasks. Anything else?

B: The second tip is your belief in your ability to improve

A: What is that?

B: It is the way you think about your abilities and talents. These beliefs can influence how you act when you are faced with setbacks. You should think they can be developed like muscle. If you think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow

A: This tip will need time to practice. Is that all?

B: Actually, there is one more tip. It is practicing failure.

A: I hate failure

B: Yes. We hate failure, but you have to face the fact that, you are going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. If you fail regularly and keep trying anyway, you will be better equipped to respond to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. You learn how to try different strategies, ask others for advice, and persevere
