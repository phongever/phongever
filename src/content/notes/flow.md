A: What is flow?

B: Flow is more than just concentrating or paying attention. It is an altered state of consciousness with several defining features

A: What are they?

B: First, those in flow tend to feel so effortlessly engaged in a task that time seems to fly by. They are not easily distracted. In contrast with cycles of procrastination, where it can feel impossible to start an activity, during flow it can feel difficult to stop. Flow also tends to diminish feelings of worry or self-judgment, in turn fostering creativity. You also experience a sense of oneness with what you are doing, allowing for peak performance

A: How can I find the flow?

B: You can do that when you do things you find intrinsically motivating, meaning activities you find purpose, meaning, or enjoyment in. This may include participating in a favorite hobby, but also tackling gratifying assignments at work, studying topics you find interesting, or even completing satisfying chores. Likewise, it may be more difficult to find flow in tasks you do only because you have to, not because you want to

A: If a task is too easy, I may get distracted or bored; or if it is too challenging, I may become discouraged. What should I do?

B: The classicly mesmerizing game of Tetris, for example, keeps skill-challenge levels in balance by increasing the fall speed of blocks as players get better at the game. It's most important that you have clear goals when you do activities to allow you to assess your progress along the way

A: What should I do exactly?

B: For example, practicing a song allows you to gauge your performance with each note. This also may be why people find flow when playing games of chance even though those games don't require skill. Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough to motivate deep engagement

A: Are there any tips to find the flow?

B: While no single protocol can guarantee flow, there are steps you can take to increase your chances. Find a quiet environment. Free from distracting noises or devices. Break your tasks into small, specific segments that are easy to track and learn from. Set clear end goals that are challenging but not frustratingly so.

A: What if I find the task to be tedious?

B: You can set additional parameters to up the stakes. For example, when cleaning your dishes, attempt to finish them all in a certain amount of time. When running, try to keep pace with the beat of a song. Most importantly, and perhaps most frustratingly, don't focus too much on reaching flow. That sort of distraction might just prevent you from finding it
