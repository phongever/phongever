**Self-interested agent**: an agent has own descriptions of the world and acts based on this description

Each agent has a **utility function**:

- **Quantifies** degree of preference toward the outcome
- Attitude toward **uncertainty**
- **Decision-theoretic rationality**: act to maximize expected utility

## Game's key ingredients

- Players
- Actions
- Payoffs

## Normal form game <N, A, u>

- N: Players
- A: Action set
- u: Utility function

## Nash equilibrium

A player can achieve the desired outcome by remaining their initial strategy

Each player's strategy is optimal when knowing other player's decisions

Players win because they get their own desired outcomes

A game may have multiple Nash equilirium or none at all
