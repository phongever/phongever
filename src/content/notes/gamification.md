## Pyramid of elements

Dynamics: Big-picture aspects (grammar)

- Constraints
- Emotions
- Narrative
- Progression
- Relationships

Mechanics: Processes that drive action forward (verbs)

- Challenges
- Chance
- Competition
- Cooperation
- Feedback
- Resource acquisition
- Rewards
- Transactions
- Turns
- Win states

Components: Specific instantiations of mechanics and dynamics (nouns)

- Achievements
- Avatars

- Boss fights
- Collections
- Combat
- Content unlocking
- Gifting
- Leaderboards
- Levels
- Points
- Quests
- Social graph
- Teams
- Virtual goods

- Fungible

Badge

## Behaviorism

- Observation
- Feedback loops
- Reinforcement

People make mistakes consistently

- Loss aversion
- Power of defaults
- Confirmation bias

Reward structures

- Tangible/intangible
- Expected/unexpected
- Contingency (task non-contingent, engagement contingent, completion-contingent, performance-contingent)

Reward schedules

- Continuous
- Fixed ratio
- Fixed interval
- Variable

  - Competitive/non-competitive
  - Certain/uncertain

## Extrinsic motivation

SAPS

- Status
- Access
- Power
- Stuff

Design thinking

- Purposive
- Human centered (Experience)
- Balance of analytical and creative
- Iterative (prototyping + playtesting)

## Gamification design framework

**Define business objectives**

- List and rank possible objectives
- Eliminate means to ends
- Justify objectives

**Delineate target behaviors**

- Specific
- Success metrics
- Analytics

  - DAU/MAU
  - Virality
  - Volume of activity

**Describe players**

- Acting + content = express
- Interacting + content = explore
- Players + interacting = collaborate
- Players + acting = compete

**Devise activity loops**

Engagement loops: Motivation -> Action -> Feedback -> Motivation

Progression loops

**Don't forget the fun**

**Deploy the approriate tools**
