A: I was scolded by my dad for slouching at my family dinner last night

B: I think your dad was right

A: You think so. Why?

B: Because your posture, the way you hold your body while you are sitting and standing, is the foundation for every movement your body makes. It can also determine how well your body adapts to the stresses on it

A: What stresses are you talking about?

B: These stresses can be things like carrying weight or sitting in an awkward position, and gravity

A: What will happen if my body is not optimal under these stresses?

B: Your muscles have to work harder to keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight and inflexible. Others will inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair the body's ability to deal with the forces on it.

A: Is it bad?

B: Yes, it is really bad. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear on your joints and ligaments. It increases the likelihood of accidents and makes some organs like your lungs less efficient. The poor posture also links to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain

A: I sometimes feel those pains when I sit for a long time

B: Yeah. It can even influence your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain

A: I want to maintain good posture but it is hard. I have to look downward to use computers and mobile devices

B: You can try redesigning your environment. You should adjust your screen at or slightly below eye level. This will keep your neck vertical, not tilted forward. Make sure all parts of your body like your elbows and wrists are supported. This helps your shoulders relax with your arm close to your trunk. You also need to pay attention to your leg. Your knees should be at a right angle with your feet flat on the floor.

A: Is that all?

B: No. You should try to sleep on your side with your neck supported and with the pillow between your legs. Your lifestyle is important too

A: Like?

B: You should wear shoes with low heels and good arch support, and use the headset for phone calls. Remember to keep your muscles moving because being stationary for long periods with good posture can be worse than regular movement with bad posture

A: How can I do that?

B: If you sit a lot, get up and move around on occasion. If you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you are carrying close to you. Backpacks should be in contact with your bad and carried symmetrically. Be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits to your joints, bones, brain, and heart
