## Poor posture

If the posture isn't optimal, muscles have to work harder to keep body balance

Muscles become tight and inflexible

Poor posture inflicts wear and tear on joints and ligaments

Increase the likelihood of accidents and make organs less efficient

Make tension headache and back pain

Influence emotional state and sensitive to pain

## Good posture

Look from front or back, the spine is a straight line

From a side, the spine has three curves: one at the neck, one at the shoulder, one at the back

When standing up, can draw a straight line from shoulder to hip to knee to ankle

When sitting,

- neck is vertical
- shoulders relax
- arms close to trunk
- knees are at the right angle
- feet flat on the floor

## Keep good posture

Adjust screen to or slightly below eye level

Make body is suppored

Sleep on side with neck supported and pillow between legs

Wear shoes with low heel and good arch support

Keep muscle and joint moving

Keep anything carrying close to the body

Backpack is in contact with the back and carried symetrically

Exercise regularly
