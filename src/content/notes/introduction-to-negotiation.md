## Week 1

**The pie**: how much two parties A and B can achieve by working together than they can get if they don't reach an agreement

The pie = net benefit from working together - (A's net benefit + B's net benefit)

## Week 2

Never say no. Let the other say

## Week 3

**Pareto optimality**: If everyone prefers B over A, never choose A

Don't fight fire with fire

## Week 4

**Anchoring**

- Starting too low or too high may be counter productive
- A low anchor might help get a higher price

Don't lie

## Week 5

**Added value**: the size of the pie when the player is in the game minus the size of the pie when the player is not in the game

The player will never get more than their added value
