FOCUS on language that is relevant

Use new language as a tool to COMMUNICATE from DAY ONE.

Listen A LOT

Focus on getting the meaning FIRST

When you first UNDERSTAND the MESSAGE, you will unconsciously ACQUIRE the language

MIXING

Focus on CORE

Get a language parent

COPY the face

CONNECT directly to the MENTAL IMAGES

Consistent PRACTICE

Make MISTAKES

ENJOY the process

Be PATIENT
