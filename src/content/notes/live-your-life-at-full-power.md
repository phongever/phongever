# Take the NAIL out of your head

## Buckets of nails:

- Bad habits
- Unresolved past experience
- Rules or Assumptions
- Fear keeping you stuck

## How to remove the nail

- Admit it
- Things will get worse first

# Follow your energy

- Spend time doing things that you are excited about
- Try things
- What would I do if wouldn't fail?

# Go all-in. Now

- Fully commit to things
- You + Energy + All-in + As long as it takes = Enough
