A: How can I lose weight for Lunar New Year?

B: You need to gradually decrease your calorie intake, and increase your regular exercise

A: How will it help me lose weight?

B: With less energy coming in and more being expended, you are creating an energy deficit inside your body. To compensate, your body begins breaking down your emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver in the form of glycogen. Then, after four to six hours, your body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds that float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues

A: Why do I have to exercise regularly?

B: It helps you maintain your muscle mass. You will use more energy both during exercise and at rest

A: I don't want to exercise. It will take so much time. I want something faster

B: If you do that, you are risking your health

A: What?

B: If you dramatically cut your calorie intake, your body will respond by going into a starvation response. It breaks down your entire store of emergency glucose in just eighteen hours. Desperate for energy, your body starts breaking down other materials, including your muscles. Losing muscle mass means you will burn fewer calories than ever for your body's basic functions. It is even more difficult for you to lose weight

A: If I lose muscle and other materials, this means my weight decreases, isn't that right?

B: It is only what you think

A: Why do you say that?

B: Every gram of glycogen is bound to several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms of water weight, all of which is lost when the glycogen is depleted. It may seem like you are losing weight fast, but as soon as you stop starving yourself, your body will replenish its glycogen store and regain that weight

A: So what I heard about fast-moving diets are lies

B: Yes, whether you cut calories or food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system, and cause some bad side effects

A: Okay, I will decrease calorie intake and exercise regularly. By the way, do I have to restrict certain types of food?

B: It depends. It can be useful for addressing some nutritional problems, but can also be a disaster if you are high in nutrition

A: You think how long I will gain my target weight

B: It is up to your genetic and medical condition, and you should consider it a sustainable dietary lifestyle. Don't feel pressured to diet for reasons other than health and happiness. Rather than trying to lose weight fast, you should be taking your time to figure out what the healthiest lifestyle is for yourself
