A: How can I know whether I am a night owl or an early bird?

B: There's a lot of space between these extremes, and most people fall somewhere in the middle

A: Why is that?

B: These behaviors are determined by your circadian system. These nerve cells respond to light exposure coming into your eyes to track the day-night cycle that dictates your body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm. That steady rhythm helps determine the body's flow of hormones, with the broader circadian system acting like a conductor that keeps your organs functioning in time with one another. A major part of that performance is managing the body's transitions between being awake and being asleep

A: How does the circadian system decide when I am awake or asleep?

B: Your circadian system can't just decide its bedtime and knock you out. However, by tracking how much light you typically get and when in your waking hours you usually get it, the system can make predictions about when you're likely to need sleep and prepare your body accordingly

A: If this rhythm is molded by my sleep habits, can I change it just by sticking to a strict schedule?

B: To a degree, everyone's bodies are unique, so even two people with the same sleep schedule might have different experiences based on their circadian system's hormonal quirks

A: What do you mean?

B: For example, where early birds generally flood with cortisol just before waking up, night owls often have their cortisol peak roughly 30 minutes after getting up. Hormonal differences like these determine how you experience your circadian rhythm. While these factors can shift with age, you're unlikely to grow out of your body's preferred sleep schedule

A: But can I cultivate habits to help or hinder my circadian rhythm?

B: Yes, you can. Keeping consistent sleeping hours helps your body accurately predict when to send out hormones, making it easier to stick to your schedule. Getting sufficient contrast between bright daylight and dimmer nighttime light is essential for synchronizing your circadian rhythm

A: How can I do that?

B: Nothing establishes this contrast better than sunlight. Even on overcast days, sunlight is much brighter than standard indoor lighting, so you're typically awake during the day. Try getting outside as soon as possible to teach your body when to be active and alert

A: Does the change last forever?

B: It's difficult to maintain a sleep schedule that pushes against your body's preferences. Even if you succeed for months, it only takes one bad night to send your circadian back to baseline. But whether you're an early bird, night owl, or somewhere in between, it's important to remember that as long as you're consistent, there's no wrong time to wake up or go to sleep. What matters most is getting enough rest for the day ahead
