## Choking boils down to focus

The mind is preoccupied with worry, doubt, fear

Instead of focusing attention on performing tasks

## Explicit monitoring

Pressure causes people to overanalyze the task

Think about precise mechanic interfere with the ability to do it

## How to avoid choking

- Practice under stressful condition
- Perform virtue before performance
