## How the brain learns and stores information

When learning a new concept, the memory is temporarily encoded in groups of neurons in hippocampus

Continue to learn the concept, reactivate the same neurons, strengthen the connection between the cells, stabilize the memory

Gradually, the concept is stored long-term in neocortex

Each time recalling the concept, reactivate the long-term memory, update the knowledge, strengthen, reintegrate with other information

## Test with flashcards and quizzes

## Mix the concept while testing

## Spacing the review across multiple days
