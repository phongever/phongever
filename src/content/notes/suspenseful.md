## The unknown

Set up questions

Make the reader curious

## Limit the pov

Tell the story from the character's pov

Choose right setting

## Style

Pay attention to what happens, and how it's conveys and pace

## Dramatic irony

Reveal key parts of the big secret to the audience

When and how the character knows the secret

## The cliffhanger

Cut off right before something crucial is revealed

In the midst of the dangerous situation
