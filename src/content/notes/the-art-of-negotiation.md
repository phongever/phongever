# Reciprocity

Do a favor for people first and they will try to repay what you has provided them

- Defuse:

  - Reject the gift
  - Accept, but be wary; if a trick, redefine relationship
  - Have a ready excuse or say "Let me think about your offer"
  - Organizational limits to what gifts employees can accept

# Commitment and consistency

Be consistent to the choice

- Defuse:

  - Ignore sunk costs
  - Have a neutral party check your judment
  - Avoid public commitments unless you are certain

# Social proof

People follow someone who is like them

- Defuse:

  - Don't just follow the crowd
  - Understand your motivations for doing something

# Liking

People easily say yes to more likable people

# Authority

People tend to say yes to people who are in position of authority (uniform, title...)

# Scarcity

People tend to assign more value to opportunities when they are less available

- Defuse:

  - Beware an andrealin rush, take a break
  - Understand your motivations
