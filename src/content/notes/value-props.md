# Three stages

## Define

### Problem

- The **target customer segments**
- Look at everything through the eyes of the customers
- Ask people what their problems are
- What is **the problem to solve**?
- 4U: unworkable, unavoidable, urgent, undeserved
- Unworkable: cause the problem that when this happens, the consequence is so greate, and somebody could get fired -> What is the root cause? -> Ask people

### Market need

- BLAC: Blatant, Latent, Aspirational, Critical
- DEBT: Dependencies, External factors, Backslack, Timing

### Solution

- 3D: Disruptive, Discontinuous, Defensible

## Evaluate

### Qualitative

- Acute pain VS Absolute joy
- Measure the **gain** delievered to the customer vs the **pain** and cost for the customer to adopt
- Gain / Pain = 10
- **Why would you not buy this product?**
- Inertia to adoption

## Build

- Bring it all together

```

```

- Build around YOU

  - Uniquely understand the problems well
  - Deliver solution uniquely well
  - Bring a kind of disruptive business model
