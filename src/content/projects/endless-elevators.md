An endless runner game

There is a man trying move to the next

He will go to the next elevator while the current elevator he is standing on is being broken. He has to estimate the height between 2 elevators before go to the next elevator. If the next elevator is higher than the current one, he will fail and game over. He will have 3 second to transfer to the next elevator before the current one breaks. If the current elevator height is equal or higher but still next to the next elevator, he can move to the next. If the current is higher than the next, he will fall and game over.
